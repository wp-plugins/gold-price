== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use this in a widget? =
Just place the shortcode into a text widget. If that doesn't work (it just renders [gold-price] in text) then that means your theme isn't 'widgetized' which you can fix easily by adding 1 tiny piece of code to your theme functions.php:

`add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');`

Add this code above to fuctions.php between the <?php and ?> tags. A good place would be either at the very top or the very bottom of the file. Once you've done this you should be able to use shortcode in widgets now.

= Why does it not update the price over the weekend? =

The markets are closed on weekends and public holidays, so the prices will stay the same untill the market opens again and the feeds are updated.

= How accurate is the price data? Where is the data coming from? =

This plugin pulls XML data feeds from dgcsc.org  The price data is surprisingly accurate although obviously we offer no guarantee. Remember "live market prices" can be extremely volatile, meaning prices can change very rapidly over a short period of time. For example, the gold price may spike up 5 dollars, then return to where it was in a matter of seconds. Our feed is only updated every 2 mins, so if there's a sudden change in price or a spike then that move could be missed completely. Likewise the price may be fetched right at the top of the spike. So keep in mind that what you're seeing is a "snapshot" of the price at a particular instant in time.

= How can I customise the design? =

You can do some basic presentation adjustments via Gold Price > Settings. Beyond this, you can completely customise the design in the custom CSS box

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =

If you've tried all the obvious stuff and it's still not working please request support via the forum.
